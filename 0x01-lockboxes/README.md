# Technical Interview: Lockboxes Project

To solve the problem of determining whether all boxes can be opened, we can model it as a _graph traversal_ problem. Each box is like a node, and each key in a box is like an edge to another node (box). Our goal is to ensure that all nodes (boxes) can be visited starting from the first node (box 0).

### Approach:
* Start from Box 0: Since box 0 is always open, we can start by adding it to a set of opened boxes.
* Use a set to track opened boxes: This will help avoid duplicate work. We'll also use a set to track the keys we collect.
* Iterate over collected keys: As long as we have keys to new boxes that haven't been opened, continue unlocking boxes.
* Check if all boxes are opened: At the end of the process, if the number of opened boxes equals the total number of boxes, return True. Otherwise, return False.
