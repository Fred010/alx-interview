# N-Queens Problem: A Classic Puzzle

### Problem Statement

The N-Queens puzzle is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The objective is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. A queen can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

### Solution Approach

A common approach to solving the N-Queens problem is backtracking. This involves:

* Placing a Queen:
Start with the first row and place a queen in the first column.
* Checking for Conflicts:
Check if the newly placed queen conflicts with any previously placed queens.
* Backtracking:
If a conflict is detected, backtrack to the previous row and try placing the queen in the next column.
* Recursive Placement:
If no conflict is found, recursively place queens in subsequent rows.
* Solution Found:
If all N queens are placed without conflicts, a solution is found.

### Implementation
Here's a basic Python implementation using backtracking:
```
Python
def is_safe(board, row, col, N):
    # Check this row on left side
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    for i, j   
 in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    # Check lower diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, N, 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    return True   


def solve_n_queens_util(board, col, N):
    if col >= N:
        return True

    for i in range(N):
        if is_safe(board, i, col, N):
            board[i][col] = 1

            if solve_n_queens_util(board, col + 1, N):
                return True

            board[i][col] = 0

    return False

def solve_n_queens(N):
    board = [[0   
 for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0, N):
        print("Solution does not exist")
        return False

    print_solution(board,   
 N)
    return True

def print_solution(board, N):
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            print(board[i][j], end=' ')
        print()

# Example usage:
N = 8
solve_n_queens(N)
```

### Key Points:
* Backtracking: The core technique to explore different possibilities and revert when a dead-end is reached.
* Conflict Checking: The is_safe function efficiently checks for conflicts in the current row, upper diagonal, and lower diagonal.
* Recursive Approach: The solve_n_queens_util function recursively places queens and backtracks when necessary.
* Solution Printing: The print_solution function visualizes the final solution.

### Further Exploration:
* Optimization Techniques: Explore techniques like pruning to reduce the search space.
* Alternative Algorithms: Consider other algorithms like Dancing Links or constraint satisfaction problems for more efficient solutions.
* Visualizations: Create visualizations to better understand the backtracking process.
* Variations: Explore variations of the N-Queens problem, such as placing more than one queen per row or column.

## By understanding the basic backtracking approach and the implementation details, you can delve deeper into the N-Queens problem and its various solutions.
